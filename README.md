# 3DANTS
An Open Source System Level Simulator for Unified 3D Networks: Bringing Space segments (GEO and LEO satellites) with Air segmenst (HAPS and UAVs) to terrestrila network. 
Unified 3D networks will emerge in 6G by integrating Non Terrestrial Networks and in current use Terrestrial Networks in a unified way to bring seamless connectivity to different areas. A unified 3D network is formed of three layers of space, air, and terrestrial nodes, each of which has its own dynamic and channel properties, resulting in spatial-temporal evolution of each communication link. This repository presents an open source system level simulator named 3DANTS which enables us to define the desired 3D network and evaluate each link quality in forms of channel, beamforming, SINR and achievable data rate over specific area and time.
# Installation
The 3DANTS is Python based system level simulator which allows you by using its building blocks to create a 3D networks and simulate the desired nodes, such as GEO satellite, LEO satellites in Walker constellation, High ALtitude Platform Stations (HAPSs), UAVs and terrestrial nodes and Base stations. It has three functional block of:
Position and Mobility
Communication Channel 
Traffic 
and the main engine which runs over the amount of simulation time.
